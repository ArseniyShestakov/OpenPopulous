New proposed format for levels

levl2001.lev

The new format for the level will contain the map (land & objects), the header (name, allies, attributes and available spells) and the scripts. This will mean that everything about the level is now all in one file which can then be compressed.

Compression could probebly be a simple run-length encoding.
