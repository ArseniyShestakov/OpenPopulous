OpenPop is an open source clone of Populous 3: The Beginning. It tries to provide the same experience but also adding new features to the game.

OpenPop needs a 3D globe engine written in OpenGL and C++. If you are experienced in those areas or have some idea then contact us if you would like to work with our other developers on OpenPop.

Other areas of development use physics, 2D and 3D rendering.

If you have not played Populous then look around for Populous fan sites where you can find out how to get it. It is basically a 1998 god game where you control a tribe of people, build your settlement and fight other tribes using your Shaman who can cast magical spells such as Tornadoes, Earthquakes and Volcanoes which can destroy their huts.
