<h1>Bugs &amp; Glitches</h1>
<p>Here are many of the glitches in Pop 3. Should we keep them or ditch them?</p>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Followers can avoid combat by continuously pressing G to force them to guard the shaman. This also allows them to get past some un-walkable areas of land.</li>
  <li>Firewarriors can avoid combat using G and end up killing any enemies quickly without losing health.</li>
  <li>Shaman's can avoid combat and get past un-walkable areas by selecting a spell and holding control and clicking outside of her spell range.</li>
  <li>Guard posts can be used to force people to get past even steeper land.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Huts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If the population is under the current maximum limit then new braves will be created when the hut is dismantled partially and then built again. A quick way of getting mana and extra people.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Blast</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Blast can be used to stop the player's shaman from rolling or losing health.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Landbridge</h3>
<ul>
  <li>High hills or mountains can be created from low land by using landbridge on a small thin point or slope.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hypnotise</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When sending hypnotised followers to a training hut they will join your side permanently after being trained into something different.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Volcano</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Volcanoes can be frozen by using landbridge three times over the land that the volcano will errupt which causes the small patch of lava to be frozen for the rest of the game.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teleport</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When using teleport you have a small amount of time to cast another spell. By the time the spell has been casted the shaman has been teleported, this causes the spell to have been casted from her new location. Most spells this is not a problem apart from landbridge where the player can make a very long bridge.</li>
</ul>
