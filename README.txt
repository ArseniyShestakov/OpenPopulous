1.0) About:
---- ------
OpenPop is an open source clone of Populous: The Beginning, a popular game originally
written by Bullfrog and published by Electronic Arts in 1998. Originally an online
lobby was run by EA to provide a online gaming service for the community. In 2004 EA
shut down the service but it was revived by Populous Reincarnated who continues to
provide the service ever since. Although there have been official and unofficial patches
to fix some of the bugs in Populous there is still a great deal that could be improved.
OpenPop attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it
with new features.

OpenPop is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.0. For
more information, see the file 'COPYING'.
